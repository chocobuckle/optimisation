# Performance and Rendering Optimisation

A website performance/rendering optimisation, submitted as a project for the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree program.

## Getting Started

Either click [here](https://chocobuckle.github.io/performance-optimisation/) to open the site via Github Pages, or just clone/download the repo, unzip the folder to your destination of choice, then click on index.html in the project root folder to open the site in your default web browser. The site is already built, but if you want to test the build process just navigate to the project folder and run 'npm install' to download and install all required dependencies, then run 'npm start' to build the site again.

## Website Performance Optimisation

The project is divided into two parts, the first entailing a website performance optimisation, and the second a browser rendering optimisation. In the first part we were tasked with optimising index.html so that it achieves a Google Pagespeed score of at last 90 for mobile and desktop. I achieved a score of 96 for mobile and 97 for desktop. The optimisations I made are as follows:

*
* The goal is to collect all the treasure required to open one of the doors on the far side of road, whilst avoiding the ladybugs.
* Treasure chests can only be opened by first collecting the necessary key.
* You have 3 lives and there are 10 levels. The ladybugs will get faster as you progress and the levels will get increasingly more diffiult to navigate, but patience is your friend. Don't panic and you'll make it to the end.

## Browser Rendering Optimisation

* Use the arrow keys to move.
